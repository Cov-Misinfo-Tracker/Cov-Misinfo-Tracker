## Who are we?

We are Cov-Misinfo Tracker and we are a team of biomedical engineers eager to solve the world's next challenging problem with the power of Google Cloud and Twitter. 

## What is the problem?

Due to the ever-present and rising hysteria about the on-going pandemic, misinformation about COVID-19 can be found spreading like wildfire through social media. This becomes a problem for most people as they are dependent on various forms of social media for their daily pandemic updates. 

## What is our solution?

Our proposed solution is a system that would analyze tweets based on hashtags typically used in non-factual COVID-19 related statements to determine the . We focused on using Twitter as the primary social media platform since it focuses on key words and allows people to post to a wider audience than other channels. Moreover, Twitter has been successfully used in prior research on blogs, images and textual information   

## How is it done?

Using the diverse functionalities and API's available through the Google Cloud Platform as well as the Twint tool to scrape through desired tweets, we are able to create an application that can be used as a means of understanding  as well as education. Using the Natural Language processing API we will be able to extract pertinent information from what is being tweeted and store that in a readable format for our database, Firebase. Firebase will store that information and parse through that information and will interact with the Google Maps API where it will find matches based on the location of the student and senior. If they are within a certain range of one another, it will be a match! Once matched, the needs of the senior will be passed on to the student where they will be able to address it accordingly.
